    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a nor-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
    <p>"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.</p>
    <h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Season Package: $95</li>
      <li>Patron Package: $200</li>
      <li>Single Speaker: $25</li>
    </ul>
